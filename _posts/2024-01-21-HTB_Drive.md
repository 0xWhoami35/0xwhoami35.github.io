The Drive website have register and form login . Go to create account and login to see something maybe can we exploit . 

## IDOR Attack

![](/images/drive/2024-01-21-16-25-02.png)

Now look at Dashboard . I found people file on my dashboard and i saw the link files looks likes vulnerable to IDOR so i think we need bruteforce number idor using `Burpsuite Intruder` . Open the burpsuite and turn on `Intercept` on Proxy after that click your link files and will appear the request on your `Intercept` and go to Forward to `Intruder`

As you can see here i add `ยง` at number for find files sensitive data likes password or somethings else using IDOR vulnerability . Usually a big company using uuid to prevent from attacker using IDOR or another vulnerability . This website using normal number id so attacker easily hacked the website by IDOR . So now let's we start the IDOR attack.
Go to `Payloads` and click `Payload type` and choosing `Numbers` payload type look at the below picture

Then there change the settings payload . Like the below

![](/images/drive/2024-01-21-16-40-58.png)

Then click `start` to launch attack . `From` thats means which number you want to start it . `To` means which number you want to stop .

Lolz IDOR not working `401 Unauthorized` . i gonna trying find another way . Until i found this one is `/block` directory i found it on `Upload Files` after that choosing public list then upload . Then go back to Dashboard until you found `Reserve` and click that and you will got it `/block` dir . So recall back number `401 Unauthorized` before this is 79 , 98 , 99 , 101 , 113 . Yes , I got it user pass ssh in id 79

## Shell as Martin 
User:martin 
Password:Xk4@KjyrYv8t194L!

`ssh martin@drive.htb`

![](/images/drive/2024-01-21-17-12-59.png)

Nothing here on user martin i think we need find the password to login another user . I found at `/home` directory have 4 user it is cris , git , martin , tom . Lets enum

![](/images/drive/2024-01-21-17-17-19.png)
Look at this i found backups directory maybe over there have the password . we need forward files to our local machine . You can using scp or python command so i'm choosing python to download the files .

![](/images/drive/2024-01-21-17-32-00.png)

I got password from `tomHands` . The hashing used Django(SHA-1) . I tried anything hash identification no one working . Only this website working [Hash Identifier](https://www.onlinehashcrack.com/hash-identification.php)
The password:`sha1$kyvDtANaFByRUMNSXhjvMc$9e77fb56c31e7ff032f8deb1f0b5e8f42e9e3004`


So now lets crack the password using hashcat

![](/images/drive/2024-01-21-17-35-29.png)

hash type is 124 so lets we crack it

## Cracking SHA1 Password

`hashcat -m 124 -a 0 --force -O hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`

`sha1$kyvDtANaFByRUMNSXhjvMc$9e77fb56c31e7ff032f8deb1f0b5e8f42e9e3004:john316`

the password is:john316

Port 3000 usually used gitea but idk is true or not lets we forward port

## Forward Port tunnel
`ssh martin@drive.htb -L 3000:127.0.0.1:3000`

go to your browser and open this page `http://127.0.0.1:3000`


To login using  username `martinCruz` and the password here `Xk4@KjyrYv8t194L!`
i found the username on `Explore` . Success login let's check the martin repo . Look at `db_backup.sh` on `DoodleGrive` repo i found the password . The password using to extract 7z file before this . Let's copy the password and extract files before these.

![](/images/drive/2024-01-21-20-03-58.png)

Password:`H@ckThisP@ssW0rDIfY0uC@n:)`

These so much password you need crack it its take long times . I tried one by one until i found `November` is working and cracked by hashcat . I got password by `tom` 

the password is:`johnmayer7`
## Shell as Tom
![](/images/drive/2024-01-21-20-21-07.png)


Success !! login ssh as tom . Now you can see there in directory tom have doodleGrive-cli and colour red and i think that can priv esc to root because this binary have suid see the below

Lolz i found the password from strings command but its take so much times to find it because over there have so long row you need look carefully or you can using [IDA FREEWARE](https://hex-rays.com/ida-free/) this . Now let's login i've got user password


user:`moriarty`
pass:`findMeIfY0uC@nMr.Holmz!`

Creating a.c file and compile it 

```
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
void sqlite3_a_init() {
setuid(0);
setgid(0);
system("/usr/bin/chmod +s /bin/bash");
}
```
